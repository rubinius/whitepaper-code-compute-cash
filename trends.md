# Trends

A trend is like a river running from the mountains to the sea. It may twist and wind, and from any particular point on the river, it may seem that its direction is opposite what it was before. But, over the course of the river, it has a definite direction. A line drawn from source to destination shows this.

There are several trends spanning decades that are relevant to where we are now and what is developing in the very near future. These trends are especially relevant from the perspective of both the existing problems with software development and the economic opportunities unlocked by improving software development.

Many of the existing problems with software development reduce to not applying learning to how software is developed, from practices to system architectures. At the same time, the economic opportunities require accelerating the rate at which learning changes practices and tools.

Purpose-built is not the same as customization, it's the opposite of general
purpose.

## De-materialization and De-energization

## Automation of Work

This impacts identity and social standing. [^1]

causing greater social consequences than automation's impact on buying power.
