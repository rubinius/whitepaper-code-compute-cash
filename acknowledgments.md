# Acknowledgments

I am deeply grateful to many terrific people who provided their thoughts and feedback over the years on this and related topics.

Special thanks to Evan Phoenix, creator of Rubinius, to Fred George, who introduced me to both microservices and Cynefin, and to the following people who generously committed time to conversations: Chad Slaughter, Dave Snowden, John Day, Charles Remes, Kurt Sussman, and Jared Morse.

Beyond listing them in the [References](references.md), I am grateful to the individuals who have contributed so much to helping move our understanding forward.

All errors and omissions are my own.
