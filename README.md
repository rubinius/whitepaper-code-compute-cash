# Code, Compute, Cash: Reinventing Distributed Software

Computation powers the processing and sharing of information, which is essential to advancing civilization. Unharnessed by software, computation has the utility of static electricity in a thunder storm. The limitation on harnessing computation is the cost of building software.

There is not a single notable business today that does not depend on software, and one of the most pressing business questions, often an existential one, has become: _How to build better software, faster, and cheaper?_

Marc Andreessen's statement that "software is eating the world" has been repeated _ad nauseam_, but it is misleading[^1]. _Software_ is not eating the world, _information processing_ is. And that information processing is rapidly being distributed among billions of devices connected, in some form, to the Internet.

The Internet and the platforms it enables have radically changed business during the past two decades.

The market capitalization of companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, Airbnb, Uber, and Twitter illustrate this. But the impact is not limited to companies started in the Internet era. GE is a 124-year old company that has spent a billion dollars to become a top software and analytics company.[^2]

The problem is, the Internet has not yet changed the way software is built. With rare exceptions, even when using open source components, any piece of commercial software is built almost entirely within the boundary of a single firm. Consequently, software still costs too much, takes too long to build, and too often fails to provide expected business value.

These deficiencies can be attributed to three areas: 1. the technology used to build software; 2. the ecosystem in which software is built; and 3. how costs and benefits are attributed to software.

The solution requires distributing software construction onto Internet platforms, improving the technology used to build and deliver software to support the platforms, and balancing the economics of building software.
